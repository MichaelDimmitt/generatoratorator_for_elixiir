# Core Questions:
How much do people know about generators?

Why are custom generators not often used in development?
(note: there is an advantage to copy pasting templates, as you see the code before copying it)

# generatoratorator_for_elixiir

1. Grab default generator
2. Note: It is not the way we prefer
3. Make modifications to the file, click button or run command to save the generator in example templates file.
4. Otherwise, at any moment save template example.

another ideas
1. generator migrations. analytics thing. learn what your style is that you do on a project.
2. generator command history

command line features 
1. open example templates shortcut in vscode.
2. save new example template in the project
3. save new example template globally

what mike likes
1. save templates to the example directory. (encourages convention for future team members)
ryan input - probably will only use generator one or couple times. (this will be helpful for future project, need to be global)

what ryan likes
1. example templates need to be promotable.

## distraction, Another idea
```
1. good implementation documentation cli
command === "good"

prompt, what is good about this file ? (title, description)

after, any edits need to be made? sending your to generated file, please wait.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

also, "good-template" command
good "implementations file" has a see templates link.

good-template --show
```
